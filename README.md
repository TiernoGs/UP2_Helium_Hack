# Having fun with the Jawbone UP2

This is the source code of my one-weekend Jawbone UP2 hacking session from late 2015.
Here's a link to the blogpost: [UP2 Reverse Engineering](https://stefano.brilli.me/blog/up2_reverse_engineering/).

I'm releasing the source code now because I've received a few requests reporting that after Jabowne went out of business they shut down their servers, making it impossible to use the UP bands.

Unfortunately the code I wrote it's a mess (it was just a hack after all üòÅ ), and I'm not sure it's still working because my UP2 broke, **so I cannot work on it anymore.**

I've updated the Android project to make it buildable with the latest version of Android Studio (3.0 currently), so it should compile out of the box.

I'm sorry I cannot provide more support to anyone who's interested in this project, but if you're looking into hacking the Jawbone UP2 I'm sure this will be of some help.
